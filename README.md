On the one hand, for this coursework from Web Technology, I decided to create the website of KFC in Tashkent. This is due to the fact that it is one of the most popular fast foods in my country. It was difficult for me to figure out how to create this website at first because its design style was different from others. During the creation of this website, I met some challenges with coding and designing in CSS and JavaScript. I used codes that we learned during seminars for my website, and I tried to do the same with the real one. I also added many new ideas and pages from my own creativity to make it more favorable. I added some new images and videos to my website and tried to link them with JS.
I also gained a lot of experience while creating my website, and I started to understand how to code easily and make a responsive website using HTML and CSS. When I finished my website, thanks to feedback from my teacher, I worked on my mistakes and did everything I could to truly understand my teacher's feedback. Making a website gave me an opportunity to learn more from tutorials, and it's true that learning coding from tutorials makes it easier to work.
Overall, I believe it is one of the best modules I have learned at WIUT, and I plan to go through it again and learn all seminars to create new websites.
